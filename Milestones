Line of tasks to complete Tiny Troopers:

1. Define the project's requirements (minimal viable product), features, and design choices
    a. How will we render the game?
        Chris will be addressing rendering.

    b. What and where will GUI be required? 
        Chris will be addressing GUI.

    c. Specify character differences, if any (classes, weapons, health, movement, etc)
        Steven's ideas: 
        Different classes, each with a unique weapon and skills.
        Only one weapon, but has abilities (two?). 
        Health is 100, but can vary between classes. 
        Movement is snappy (no momentum).

    d. Will there be pickups around the map(s)? (medkits, ammo, weapons, etc.)
        Steven's ideas: 
        There will be medkits that heal some amount (25?) and regenerate in ~15 seconds. 
        No ammo/reload system, aiming for continuous combat.
        One-ammo weapons spawn randomly with absurd or unique bullets (wall, lightning, wallpierce).

    e. How complex is the map(s) layout and features?
        Steven's ideas:
        Map(s) are minimalistic. No elevation system (upper/lower ground). Possibly pitfalls, destructable walls, moving walls, etc.
    
2. Create the minimum requirements of the program, test, revise

3. Create expanding features to make the game more appealing and varied
